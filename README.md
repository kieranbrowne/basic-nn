# Basic neural network in clojure

A simple, functional approach to neural networks in clojure. I've explained the code in detail [here](http://kieranbrowne.com/neural-networks-carbon-and-code/).
The example problem is borrowed from [@iamtrask](https://twitter.com/iamtrask)'s great post [A Neural Network in 11 lines of Python](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/).
